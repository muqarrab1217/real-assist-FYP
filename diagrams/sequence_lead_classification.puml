actor Visitor
participant LeadForm as "LeadForm (Landing)"
participant FrontAPI as "frontend API (src/services/api.ts)"
participant Backend as "Backend (API)"

Visitor -> LeadForm: submit lead data
LeadForm -> FrontAPI: POST /leads

Frontend mapping: landing CTA or form (src/pages/Landing/LandingPage.tsx and components)
APIs: extend src/services/api.ts to call real backend endpoints
ML: not implemented in frontend repo; implement in backend or separate microservice
